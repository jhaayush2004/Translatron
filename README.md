# Translatron

English to Hindi Translation Using Hugging Face Transformer.

## About Model
This project aims to build a translation model capable of translating English sentences to Hindi using the state-of-the-art models available through the Hugging Face Transformers library. The process involves importing a pre-trained translation model from Hugging Face, fine-tuning it on a dataset containing English-Hindi parallel sentences, and evaluating its performance.
